     Family-owned and Operated
Ray Jefferstein founded Pat's Original Salmon Cookies in 1937 at 1st and Pike

Pat took over his father's business in 1985, and has opened up four new locations

Pat lives in Seattle, together with his wife Jane and their two children Pat Jr and Mary-chinook

Pat and his family hope to share their love of salmon and cookies with you, so come down to one of our locations!

Our cookies are all made from REAL salmon

            They taste like a cake combined with a fish
            
            For the full-effect, we cut them into the shape of fish
            
            Our cookies come in 193 flavors, all with a hint of salmon!
            
            Best-enjoyed with a cup of coffee or tartar sauce</p>
